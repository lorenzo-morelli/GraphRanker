# GraphRanker
Given a graph in the form of a matrix of dimension dxd and an integer value k, the algorithm is able to return the ranking of the best k graphs based on the sum of the shortest paths from node (0,0) to all other reachable nodes of the graph. The algorithm is optimized according to temporal and spatial complexity criteria, with the employ of data structures such as the heap, and the implementation of well-known algorithms such as Dijkstra's.

The C standard version used is C11.
